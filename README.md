It reassures extra care, helpful accommodation and around the clock attention for your loved ones. 
This project was achieved through the use of various technologies, software and coding. Using an existing theme(Medical Care), set a base for the Gentle Care website as a host of sections and features were there to use and manipulate .The implementation of Custom Post types, Custom Fields, Plugins and Programming languages enabled us to create the finished product, that is Gentle Care. The general theme and graphical user interface was simplified as much as possible for ease of use and navigation to cater for the senior audience we intend to attract.

# Website Design 
The base theme used for the Gentle Care website was the Medical Care WordPress theme (free version). The Medical Care theme is one of the less popular WordPress themes with only about 500 active installations. The lack of popularity played a role in the decision of choosing this theme as we wanted our website to be unique. Additionally, since the theme is medical based, the base functionality of the theme as well as the included styling was relevant to our website and was the reason for choosing this theme.

Functionality (queries, user roles, search)
The Gentle Care website features many different functionalities. Namely, user roles and live search.
The user roles functionality allows the website’s admin to create custom user roles and permissions and assign them to certain users. For instance, managers and staff each have their own user role which allows them different levels of permission over the Gentle Care website. Additionally, a custom role is assigned to clients, that is, individuals or family members of individuals that are customers of Gentle Care. This custom role allows clients to post reviews on the website about their experience at Gentle Care. Conversely, Subscribers, the default role that is assigned to new users and non-customers/staff, can only view public content on the website but they cannot post reviews like clients.
The live search functionality allows users to search for all different types of contents on the website and view matches as they type. This is done through the use of the REST API and JSON queries using search keywords. This makes search for specific content and information easy and efficient.
